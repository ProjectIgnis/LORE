This is only as faithful as the Chinese translations are, so it might not be perfectly accurate,

Some sentence structure has been edited to flow better in English as the source material was an absolute disaster in this regard.

## Spanning across the ages, the story of the cycles of rebirth on the planet

The youth who live in this harsh world journey across the world, directed by fate, and finally are drawn into the grand conflict over the fate of the world… let's introduce the story surrounding the "Key" left behind by God, knit together by the accumulated hopes and desires of people.

### **Genesis, as told by the denizens of the Celestial Forest**

_This part seems to be structured like a poem._

```
Once upon a time, there was a God who governed the workings of the universe.
God directed His servant dragons,
To protect the universe through destruction and rebirth,
But every time that force of destruction was used, its strength would increase,
Unwittingly, the balance of power between the two collapsed massively.
The force of destruction strengthened to the point that, should it go berserk, even the universe that it was supposed to protect would be devastated.
God concludes that He can no longer direct the workings of universe,
Thus He uses the force of creation to create many hard layers of geological crust as a cage,
Sealing the force of destruction in its centre.
Having no place to spill, the force of destruction ultimately becomes the blazing core of the earth.
The energies of destruction blend and fuse with the force of creation via the earth,
And the energy that at last flows out onto the surface,
Transforms into the tiny existences of repeated birth and death, giving rise to life on the earth.
God transforms His last residual fragment into a "Key",
After entrusting it to the life born on the earth, He disappears.
Many years after, the force of destruction would once again manifest on the surface,
But every time, the tiny lives would work with the dragons to suppress it.
It's not known from when, but the "Key" would be renamed to a sword, and the force of destruction renamed the "Great Darkness",
And alongside the "World Hero", these heroic legends would be passed down to the present.

"Starlight Hero, Raise Your Sword and Gather the Light, You Must Vanquish the Great Darkness"
```

## The World Chalice story unfolding around the fate of the planet / Act I

&mdash; The people guided by fate &mdash;

### Life on the planet

At its apex, the world is ruled by the seven mechanical life-forms called the "Mekk-Knights".
The "Krawlers" rampage across the surface and act as their vanguard. People can only defend the threat posed by the "Krawlers" on one hand and struggle for existence on the other.

### The denizens of the Celestial Forest

In the vast forest known as the "Celestial Forest", humans live in hiding.
In this village that believes in the Star God, they worship a ritual staff passed down through the ages. Humans use the barriers generated by the energies of the staff to protect the village from external threats.
As the inheritor of the ritual staff, "Ib" and her older brother "Ningirsu", her childhood friend "Auram", and the little dragon "Imduk" live together in the village.

_Ib is known as Eve in Japanese text but English localizations will be used where possible._

### Encountering the "World Chalice", and the "World Hero"

"Auram" and "Ningirsu" focus day and night on battling the "Krawlers" to reduce the burden of maintaining the barrier.
One day, "Ib" hears a remarkable sound from deep in the forest. With her worried friends, together they go in the direction of that sound, seemingly being guided.
In the depths of the forest, "Ib" slips and falls, discovering what seems to be a giant building-like object ahead.
The other two catch up with her and just as they approach the building together, her ritual staff emits a dazzling light, and it seems like the giant building responds in concert and activates.
While the travelers are confounded by the building that emitted the same light as the staff, the small fairy "Lee" appears in front of them.

> I shoulder the mission to guide humanity, but due to the interference of the "Mekk-Knights", I've been sealed in the "World Chalice". Since then I've been waiting for those who hold the potential to save the world and become "World Heroes" to appear.

"Lee" tells "Ib" and the rest.

_Because Japanese and Chinese lack plurals in the same sense as English, it's ambiguous as to whether "World Hero" is singular or plural._

### Accepting "World Chalice"'s power and advancing on the other "World Legacies"

> You are the "World Heroes". To unite the starlight that has been scattered and save the world from the clutches of the "Great Darkness", please be sure lend me your power.

The youth of the Celestial Forest accept the sincere wishes of fairy "Lee" to protect humanity and decide to set out on their journey.
Endowed with the power of the "World Chalice" through "Lee", the "Krawlers" they had so long struggled against are easily defeated.
And there are six more "World Legacies" with the same might in this world. If they could unite them all, they would even be able to defeat the "Mekk-Knights" &mdash; this news gave the villagers hope.

### The second "World Legacy"

The travelers arrive at the wetlands where the next "World Legacy" rests. Here waiting for them are huge numbers of "Krawlers" and the commanding "X-Krawlers".
In front of the hibernating "World Armor", the travelers are divided and at a disadvantage, ultimately relying on a clever strategy from "Lee" to silence a huge swathe of "Krawlers".

**World Legacy - "World Armor"**

To approach the "World Armor" we must pass through the "Krawlers"…

### The seven "Mekk-Knights" finally appear

Heavily wounded, the travelers finally arrive in front of the "World Armor".
Suddenly, seven coloured lights appear, and the rulers of the world, the "Mekk-Knights", appear.
Disregarding the utterly shocked "Auram" and company, the "Mekk-Knights" release energy entrapping "Ib" that not even the barrier projected from the ritual staff can defend against. Leaving behind the dumbfounded "Auram" and company, they disappear over the horizon.

**Mekk-Knight Red Moon**

![Mekk-Knight Red Moon](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/56809158.png)

The seven "Mekk-Knights":
- Mekk-Knight Red Moon
- Mekk-Knight Orange Sunset
- Mekk-Knight Yellow Star
- Mekk-Knight Green Horizon
- Mekk-Knight Blue Sky
- Mekk-Knight Indigo Eclipse
- Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall

**World Legacy Trap Globe**

"Ib", taken captive by the "Mekk-Knights".

## The two "World Legacies" en route to saving "Ib"

"Lee" tells everybody that the ritual staff and "Ib" have been taken, so seeking the other "World Legacies" is far too dangerous and they should prioritize saving "Ib".
After a lengthy search, everybody arrives at the base of the "Mekk-Knights", a cluster of ruins of the ancient civilization. Standing there is an already-activated "World Shield" and the "World Lance".

**World Legacy - "World Shield"**

**World Legacy Key**

![World Legacy Key](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/2930675.png)

Facing the "Mekk-Knights" who had imprisoned her and taken away the ritual staff, yet didn't hurt her at all, "Ib" starts doubting whether the "Mekk-Knights" truly are servants of the "Great Darkness". At this moment, "Auram" and company launch a surprise assault on the "Mekk-Knights".

**Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme**

![Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/38502358.png)

**World Legacy Whispers**

![World Legacy Whispers](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/62530723.png)

Faced with the all-out attack from "Auram" and company, the "Mekk-Knights" feel anxious and unite into "Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme". In this back-and-forth battle, "Ningirsu" finds the chance to send a signal to "Lee" &mdash; suggested by "Lee" to signal the start of her solo operation.

### The battle as planned by "Lee"

Seeing the "Lee" who snuck in alone to her side, "Ib" relaxed, and she voiced her doubts to "Lee", who should know about the truth of the "Mekk-Knights":

> Maybe we don't have to fight the Mekk-Knights.

Hearing this, "Lee" slowly turns around, and what "Ib" sees is no longer that cute expression when they initially met, but an extremely ominous and twisted smile.

**World Legacy's Secret**

![World Legacy's Secret](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/98935722.png)

**Knightmare Corruptor Iblee**

![Knightmare Corruptor Iblee](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/10158145.png)

Having revealed her true nature, "Lee" completely steals the body and consciousness of "Ib", becoming "Iblee". Although the "Mekk-Knights" noticed "Lee" disappearing, they did not have the liberty to respond in the heat of combat.

### The power of "Iblee" and the inheritor of "the power of the ritual staff"

"Ningirsu", seen as the most powerful by the "Mekk-Knights", and "Auram", who exceeds "Ningirsu" with his growing momentum, continue to battle.
At this moment, a huge explosion happens in the ruins.
The "World Chalice" releases even greater power than when it was activated, and in the next instant, "she" shows herself.
Though her appearance is the same, the evil miasma emanating from her body signals that she was no longer "Ib".
A creepy smile crawls across her face as she announces that she is "Lee", and this body is now also hers.
Quickly, "Iblee" releases shockwaves, forcibly revoking the "World Chalice" powers granted to "Auram" and company, wanting to take their lives.
Unexpectedly, the "Mekk-Knights" stand in her way.

**World Legacy's Corruption**

![World Legacy's Corruption](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/62279666.png)

**World Legacy Succession**

![World Legacy Succession](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/99674361.png)

The "Mekk-Knights" cannot defend against the power of "Iblee" and are forced to separate out of the "Spectrum Supreme" form.
"Iblee" forcibly removes their cores and attempts to retrieve the ritual staff that is sealed in the core of "Blue Sky".
Knowing that the ritual staff is in fact the "World Key" that would decide the fate of the world, the "Mekk-Knights" in desperation try to pass its inheritance rights to "Auram".
"Auram" opens his heart to the "Mekk-Knights" and inherits the power of the ritual staff, transforming the "Key" into twin swords.

**Mekk-Knight Blue Sky**

"Auram", who inherits the "power of the ritual staff".

**Mekk-Knight Avram**

![Mekk-Knight Avram](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/84754430.png)

### Crusade against "Iblee"

Though "Auram" inherited the "Key", since it was not directly via the true successor "Ib", but through the intermediary of the "Mekk-Knights", its power was divided into a pair of swords.
Knowing that "Ib" who sleeps in her body also wields the right of inheritance, "Iblee" is one step ahead of "Auram", who just obtained the power of the "Key", to rush to the "World Lance".
"Auram" gives chase but is intercepted by the monstrous "Knightmares" created by "Iblee" and becomes embroiled in a bitter fight.
At this moment, "Ningirsu" and "Imduk" catch up.
Although in the preceding battle they had lost the power of the "World Chalice", "Auram" makes a dash for the "World Lance" with their help, but is still short of "Iblee" by just an instant. "Iblee" activates the "World Lance" first and thus everybody is exposed under the violent attacks.

**World Legacy's Nightmare**

![World Legacy's Nightmare](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/25163979.png)

### The monstrous "Knightmares" created by "Iblee"

"Iblee" created monsters via the "Mekk-Knight" cores, which each inherited the unique abilities of the "Mekk-Knights".
Rushing to the side of "Auram", who was in bitter combat, "Ningirsu" kills "Mermaid" in one desperate blow.
To allow "Auram" to give chase to "Iblee", "Ningirsu" distracts the remaining six "Knightmares", thus opening up a way forward.

**Knightmare Mermaid**

**Knightmare Unicorn**

### The consciousness of "Ib" resists "Lee" and the conclusion of the tragedy &mdash;

Just when "Iblee" picked up the sword to deliver the final blow to "Auram", who had been felled and injured by the power of the "World Lance", "Imduk" jumped in.
In the face of the imminent danger of "Auram", he finally releases a part of his power as a servant of God.
Though brief, this suppresses the consciousness of "Lee" at the surface, so the suppressed "Ib" awakens from the deep.
Facing the fallen "Auram" and the sword in her hand, she immediately understands the situation and makes her decision. "Ib" points the sword in her hand at herself and stabs…

_Note: "Imduk" is not referred to with a masculine pronoun._

**World Legacy Awakens**

![World Legacy Awakens](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/12989604.png)

**World Legacy Struggle**

![World Legacy Struggle](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/58374719.png)

**World Legacy's Sorrow**

![World Legacy's Sorrow](https://pics.alphakretin.fail/lotd/85763457.png)

The power of feelings and thoughts is a strength of living beings and also easily becomes a weakness.
As long as "Lee" possessed the physical body of "Ib", "Auram" who shared close bonds with "Ib" could never face that form in arms.
"Iblee" was so proud, but the growth of "Auram", the resolve of the "Mekk-Knights", the fierce fight by "Ningirsu", and the awakening of "Imduk" &mdash; these tiny flaws accumulating led to a fatal anomaly, finally crushing her ambitions.
But for "Auram" and the other "Chalice" warriors, this is a nightmarish conclusion.
